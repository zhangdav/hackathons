Trivia is a cutting-edge DeFi protocol designed to help retail investors understand the macroeconomics factors that rule the financial markets so they could make informed decisions when investing. ✨

## Inspiration

There are three main challenges retail investors face nowadays:

• **The first and most important one is losing money with every single invesment:** A significant proportion of retail investors navigate choppy waters. With a range of 69% to 84% facing losses, it’s evident that retail investing, while offering potential rewards, carries substantial risks.

• **The stock markets have high volatility and complexity:** Such pronounced loss percentages highlight the unpredictable nature of the market and the steep learning curve many individual investors face.
• **Most retail investors lack financial literacy and risk management:** Given the high rate of losses among retail investors, there’s an imperative need for enhanced financial education, robust risk-management tools, and informed decision-making in the retail investment arena.

## What it does

What we look with this project is to help users understanding and making money in the financial markets with a zero-loss betting approach, while mitigating risk and improving financial literacy for individual investors.
